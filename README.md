Level of Achievement: 
    Apollo 11
    
Motivation:
    Every hall resident will eventually need to join some hall CCAs. But currently, the system is not very well organized. All  
    residents join the CCAs through the introduction of their peers or at the CCA fair at every start of the academic year. Besides 
    that, the heads of CCA have to manually record the information of each member of the CCA and update marks using Excel or other 
    software, which is quite troublesome and not convenient. Furthermore, residents have to make the effort to be present at the 
    CCA fair to sign up or learn more about the CCA in the hall. Residents also cannot easily retrieve information about their 
    attendance and points in the CCA, they have to ask the particular CCAâ€™s head for the details, causing a lot of extra work for 
    everybody.

Aim:
    We hope to create a website to automate and make the process of signing up and retrieving information about each CCA smoother 
    and more convenient.
