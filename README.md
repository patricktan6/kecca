# KECCA

## Level of Achievement:

Apollo 11

## Motivation:

Every hall resident will eventually need to join some hall CCAs. However, the current system is not very well organized. Residents have to join the CCAs through peer introductions or at the CCA fair. Besides that, the heads of CCA have to manually record the information of each member of the CCA and update marks using Excel or other software, which is quite troublesome and inconvenient. Furthermore, residents have to sign up and learn more about the CCAs at the CCA fair.

## Aim:

We hope to create a website that assists the CCA sign ups and make the CCA management easier.

## User Stories

    1.As a resident, I want to be able to sign up for the CCA I want through an online portal.

    2.As a head of CCA, I want to be able to update my members' attendance and points online.

    3.As a head of CCA, I want to be able to get information about my members more easily.

## Project Scope:

An online platform for halls to better organize CCA affairs and other relevant information, such as enrolment, records of members' attendance and other information. (similar to something like ModReg)

    Registration:
    Allow residents to sign up for the CCA that they are interested in.

    Administrative matters:
    Allow CCA heads or admins to mark attendance and allocate points for their members.
    Allow CCA to post announcements about events or information about the time and venue of training sessions.
